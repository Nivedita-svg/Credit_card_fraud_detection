# Credit_card_fraud_detection
This project focuses on developing a robust machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. Given the significant impact of fraudulent activities on financial institutions and customers, accurate detection is crucial.

Key Components:

* Data Preprocessing: The dataset undergoes cleaning, scaling, and handling of class imbalances using SMOTE to ensure balanced training.

* Feature Engineering: Innovative features are created to enhance model performance, and PCA is employed to reduce dimensionality.

* Modeling: Multiple algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting, are implemented. Ensemble techniques further improve prediction accuracy.

*Evaluation: Models are evaluated using various metrics and cross-validation to ensure reliability and robustness.

*Pipeline: A complete machine learning pipeline is developed, streamlining the entire process from preprocessing to prediction.

The enhancements ensure a comprehensive and efficient approach to credit card fraud detection, leveraging advanced techniques to achieve high accuracy and reliability.
